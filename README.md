daloRADIUS is an advanced RADIUS web management application aimed at managing hotspots and general-purpose ISP deployments. It features user management, graphical reporting, accounting, a billing engine and integrates with GoogleMaps for geo-locating.

daloRADIUS is written in PHP and JavaScript and utilizes a database abstraction layer which means that it supports many database systems, among them the popular MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite, MsSQL, and many others.

It is based on a FreeRADIUS deployment with a database server serving as the backend. Among other features it implements ACLs, GoogleMaps integration for locating hotspots/access points visually and many more features.
